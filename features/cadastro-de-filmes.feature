    Scenario: Duplicated

        The administrador of the catalog tries to register a movie, but the title has already been
        registered, and the system notifies the user that the title informed already exists.

        Given that "deadpool2" is a new movie
        But it already exists in the catalog
        When I do the movie register
        Then I should see the warning "Oops - Este titulo j√° existe no Ninjaflix."
